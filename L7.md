clustering problem
1, 3 go into one group
group of genes 

until you can not find better solution no matter how you shift chromosomes

GO graph is a kind of graph
If there is more than one or no path from root to some node then this is a graph not a tree

change the structure of tree to optimize it

matrix can be converted a graph

many 0 may waste space

purify 
describe the algorithm in a way the teacher can understand
connect to the course
run time performance represent the matrix n nlogn
Basic explaination
